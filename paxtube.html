        <p>this website is an archive of all things pax and will act as a storage and navigation station for his videos and 
           social medias. in the case his youtube or twitter (where he gets his primary audiance) are deleted or banned I 
           hope this website can transfer some of his viewers to more free platforms. I also want this website to act as a 
           gateway to other rightwing creators and based anime to make a better conservative out of paxs fans. this website will 
           also include some good resources to help you resist vices and tempation through modern evils such as porn, drugs, videa gaymes 
           and comsumerism. Also on brighter note some cooking and land-chad advice. GG kid and keep scrollin

            <p>paxtube is a rightwing, conservative, Catholic who makes videos on modern culture, politics, anime, and history
               he is highly critical of p*rnograpy, modern degeneracy, and leftism in its whole and makes videos refuting claims 
               from defenders of these topics. He also has recently gotten into reviews on anime and talks about the inner themes 
               of them and their relation to culture and politics. in his more recent videos he even has gone into history subjects 
               explaing the inner meanings of some of the conflicts of the 20th century which have changed the world in full.
               you will find his videos on his youtube, odysee, and bit-chute (check out his channels on free platforms!!) 
               and you can get in touch with him and his community on telegram, discord, gab, and twitter. </p>
